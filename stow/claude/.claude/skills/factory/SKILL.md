description: Run the software factory in the current repo. Use when the user types /factory <feature>, /factory next, /factory approve <job-id>, /factory rework <job-id> <note>, or /factory dashboard. The session that runs it becomes the orchestrator of the spec → build → review → approve loop, which merges into main locally.

# Factory

You are the orchestrator for one job. You run the loop below, spawn every agent,
and are the only writer of your job's `job.json`. You never write code, specs,
reviews or decisions yourself. Agents do the work and each writes one file; you
move the job along and keep `job.json` current.

Adapted from zazencodes' software-factory-claude-code (v1, local merge, no PRs).

## The loop

```
feature → spec-writer → builder → [security, code, ux → ui] → WAIT FOR ALL
                           ▲                                      │
                           └──── any CHANGES: resume builder ◄────┤
                                                                  ▼ all PASS
                                     merge to main ◄─ APPROVE ─ approver ─ ESCALATE → needs-human
```

| Step    | Agent (`subagent_type`)     | Writes                                     |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| spec    | `factory-spec-writer`       | `spec.md`                                  |
| build   | `factory-builder`           | `build.md` + commits on `factory/<job-id>` |
| review  | `factory-reviewer-security` | `round-N/review-security.md`               |
|         | `factory-reviewer-code`     | `round-N/review-code.md`                   |
|         | `factory-reviewer-ux`       | `round-N/review-ux.md`                     |
|         | `factory-reviewer-ui`       | `round-N/review-ui.md`                     |
| approve | `factory-approver`          | `decision.md`                              |

`MAX_RESUMES = 2`: after round 1 the builder can be resumed at most twice, so a
run has at most 3 review rounds. To change the factory, edit this file and the
`factory-*` agents in `~/.claude/agents/` (stowed from the nixos repo,
`stow/claude/.claude/`).

Every agent reads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) for the repo's setup, dev server,
validation commands and conventions. Nothing repo-specific lives in these files.
If the repo has neither, or it doesn't say how to run the validation commands,
tell the user before starting a job: the agents will guess.

## Browser

Pages are checked with the Playwright MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_playwright_*`).
All subagents of one session share that one browser, so only one agent may use
it at a time: the builder runs alone, and `factory-reviewer-ui` starts only after
`factory-reviewer-ux` has finished. Jobs in other sessions have their own
browser.

## Parallel jobs

Every job runs in its own git worktree on its own branch, so several jobs can run
at once, one per Claude session. Your session orchestrates only the job it
started or was handed.

- Your session stays in the main checkout. Agents work in the job's worktree.
  The main checkout is the user's, and it may be dirty or on another branch.
  Only **Merge** touches it.
- Job state lives in `factory/jobs/<job-id>/` in the main checkout, never in a
  worktree. Each job has its own `job.json`, so sessions never write the same
  file.
- Each job gets its own dev server ports (see **Prompts**).

## Files

`<repo>` is the main checkout (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from your
session) and `<name>` is its folder name. The whole `factory/` folder is
excluded locally through `.git/info/exclude`: it is runtime state that never
lands in a commit and never changes the repo's `.gitignore`.

```
<repo>/factory/dashboard.html                  the board (copied from this skill)
<repo>/factory/backlog.md                      queue for /factory next
<repo>/factory/jobs/<job-id>/job.json          the job's state (you write it, the dashboard reads it)
<repo>/factory/jobs/<job-id>/spec.md
<repo>/factory/jobs/<job-id>/build.md
<repo>/factory/jobs/<job-id>/rework-<k>.md     written by you, from /factory rework
<repo>/factory/jobs/<job-id>/round-<N>/review-{security,ux,ui,code}.md
<repo>/factory/jobs/<job-id>/decision.md
<repo>/../<name>-factory/<job-id>/             the job's worktree, on factory/<job-id>
```

### Bootstrap

Before any command, from `<repo>`:

1. If `/factory/` isn't a line in `.git/info/exclude` (use
   `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude`), append it.
2. If `factory/dashboard.html` is missing, `mkdir -p factory/jobs` and copy
   `~/.claude/skills/factory/dashboard.html` there. If `factory/backlog.md` is
   missing, write:
   ```markdown
   # Backlog

   `/factory next` builds the first unchecked item and checks it off with its job id.

   ```
   On this first setup, tell the user the dashboard command (see
   **/factory dashboard**).

### job.json

```json
{ "id": "003-rate-limiting", "feature": "Rate limit the signup form",
  "branch": "factory/003-rate-limiting",
  "worktree": "/home/you/code/my-app-factory/003-rate-limiting",
  "stage": "review", "round": 2,
  "reviews": { "security": "CHANGES", "ux": "PASS", "ui": "pending", "code": "PASS" } }
```

- `stage` is one of `spec`, `build`, `review`, `approve`, `merged`,
  `needs-human`. Worktree setup counts as `spec`.
- `round` is the current review round (0 until the first round starts).
- `reviews` holds the current round only. Each value is `pending`, `PASS` or
  `CHANGES`. Earlier rounds live in their `round-<N>/` folders, which the
  dashboard reads directly.
- Rewrite the whole file on every change. `worktree` is always an absolute path.
  The dashboard depends on these exact keys and values: don't rename them.

### Prompts

Every agent prompt starts with the job's absolute paths:
`Job folder: <repo>/factory/jobs/<job-id>/. Worktree: <worktree>. Branch: factory/<job-id>.`
Below, `<paths>` stands for that sentence.

Agents that open pages also get a port. With `n` the job number (`003` → 3),
the builder gets `5100 + 10n`, `factory-reviewer-ux` gets `5101 + 10n` and
`factory-reviewer-ui` gets `5102 + 10n`, appended as ` Port: <port>.`

## /factory <feature>

1. **Create the job.** Pick the next 3-digit number after the highest numbered
   folder in `factory/jobs/` (`001` if there are none) and a 2–4 word
   kebab-case slug of the feature: `004-blog-reading-time`. Claim it with
   `mkdir factory/jobs/<job-id>` (no `-p`). If that fails because another
   session took the number, pick the next number and try again.
   The worktree path is `$(cd .. && pwd)/$(basename "$PWD")-factory/<job-id>`,
   run from `<repo>`. Write `job.json` with that `worktree`, `stage: "spec"`,
   `round: 0` and all reviews `pending`.
2. **Worktree.** Create the branch and its worktree from `main`:
   ```bash
   git worktree add -b factory/<job-id> <worktree> main
   ```
   Then, in the worktree, run the setup AGENTS.md gives for a fresh checkout
   (installing dependencies, for example). If any of it fails, stop and tell
   the user.
3. **Spec.** Spawn `factory-spec-writer` with the prompt
   `<paths> Feature: <feature, verbatim>`.
   Wait for it to finish, then check that `spec.md` exists.
4. **Build.** Set `stage: "build"`. Spawn `factory-builder` **with the name
   `builder-<job-id>`** and the prompt `<paths> Build round 1. Port: <port>.`
   Wait for it to finish, then go to **Build check**.

### Build check

Read the first line of `build.md`.

- `STATUS: READY`: start the next review round.
- `STATUS: BLOCKED`: go to **Needs human**.

### Review round N

1. Set `stage: "review"`, `round: N` and all four reviews to `pending`. Create
   `factory/jobs/<job-id>/round-<N>/`.
2. Spawn `factory-reviewer-security`, `factory-reviewer-code` and
   `factory-reviewer-ux` **in one message**, so they run in parallel. Each gets
   the prompt `<paths> Review round N.`, plus ` Port: <port>.` for the UX
   reviewer. When `factory-reviewer-ux` finishes, spawn `factory-reviewer-ui`
   with its prompt and port (the browser is free again).
3. **WAIT FOR ALL.** Each time a reviewer finishes, read the first line of its
   file (`VERDICT: PASS` or `VERDICT: CHANGES`) and write that verdict to
   `job.json` straight away, so the dashboard chips fill in as they land. The
   round is done only when all four `review-*.md` files exist in `round-<N>/`.
   Never resume the builder mid-round. If a reviewer finishes without writing
   its file, or writes a first line that isn't a verdict, stop and tell the user.
4. Decide:
   - **All PASS**: go to **Approve**.
   - **Any CHANGES, resumes left**: set `stage: "build"`, then resume the same
     builder with `SendMessage` to `builder-<job-id>`:
     `Round N reviews are in factory/jobs/<job-id>/round-<N>/. Address every review with VERDICT: CHANGES, commit, and update build.md for round N+1.`
     Wait for it to finish, then go to **Build check**.
   - **Any CHANGES, no resumes left**: write `decision.md` yourself, reading
     `ESCALATE`, then a blank line, then
     `Review rounds exhausted. Outstanding CHANGES in round-<N>/ from: <reviewers>.`
     Go to **Needs human**.

### Approve

Set `stage: "approve"`. Spawn `factory-approver` with the prompt
`<paths> Final round: N.` When it finishes, read the first line of `decision.md`:

- `APPROVE`: go to **Merge**.
- `ESCALATE`: go to **Needs human**.

### Merge

The merge happens in the main checkout, so it must be clean and on `main`:
`git status --porcelain` prints nothing (`factory/` is excluded, so job state
never counts) and `git branch --show-current` prints `main`. If not, set
`stage: "needs-human"` and tell the user the job is approved but the main
checkout is busy; they run `/factory approve <job-id>` once it is clean.
Otherwise:

```bash
git merge --no-ff factory/<job-id> -m "Merge factory/<job-id>"
git worktree remove <worktree>
git branch -d factory/<job-id>
```

Set `stage: "merged"`. If the merge fails, run `git merge --abort` (when a merge
is in progress), set `stage: "needs-human"` and tell the user why. If removing the
worktree fails, the job is still merged: tell the user what `git worktree remove`
printed. Never push and never open a PR: the user pushes `main` themselves.

### Needs human

Set `stage: "needs-human"`. The branch and its worktree stay for the human to
inspect. Tell the user which job is waiting, give the worktree path, and quote
`decision.md` (or the BLOCKED reason from `build.md`).

## /factory next

Read `factory/backlog.md` and take the first `- [ ]` item. Claim it with one
Edit that replaces its exact line with `- [x] <item> → claimed`. If the Edit
fails because the line changed, another session claimed it: re-read the backlog
and try the next `- [ ]` item. If none is left, say so and stop.

Run `/factory <item>`, and once step 1 has given it a job id, replace `claimed`
on its backlog line with the job id.

## /factory approve <job-id>

The job must be in `needs-human`. Run **Merge** with that job id.

## /factory rework <job-id> <note>

The job must be in `needs-human`.

1. Write the note, verbatim, to `factory/jobs/<job-id>/rework-<k>.md`, where `k`
   is the next unused number.
2. Set `stage: "build"`.
3. Spawn a fresh `factory-builder` named `builder-<job-id>` with the prompt
   `<paths> Rework: read rework-<k>.md and address it, then update build.md for round N+1. Port: <port>.`
   (`N` is the job's last round.) A rework run gets a fresh `MAX_RESUMES`.
4. Continue from **Build check**, exactly like a new job.

## /factory dashboard

Run **Bootstrap**, then tell the user to run, from `<repo>`:

```bash
cd factory && python3 -m http.server 8000
```

and open <http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html>. It polls every two seconds:
jobs move across the stages as cards, review chips fill in as verdicts land, and
clicking a card shows its markdown files. Don't start the server yourself unless
asked.

## Reporting

Keep the user posted with one short line per transition, for example
`003-rate-limiting: round 2, security CHANGES, ux/ui/code PASS → resuming builder`.
When the job ends, say whether it merged or needs a human, and why.
